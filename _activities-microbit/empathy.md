## Empathy

### Challenge
In this example, we are going to communicate an action from one microbit to another using the radio. Display a block in the
centre of the screen. When the first microbit is shaken it should transmit this feeling to all those around it and
make them shake their blocks too.


### Extensions

* Is there a better way to show a shaking cube with less code?
* Change the cube to another image.


### Example Solutions

```python

{% include solutions/microbit/empathy.py %}

```
