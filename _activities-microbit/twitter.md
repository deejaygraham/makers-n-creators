## Old-Timey Twitter

### Challenge

The microbit radio can be used to send text over short distances. In this exercise we will try using
the radio functions to send text messages to microbits in the immediate area. The same code should be
used on each microbit for sending and receiving.


### Extensions

* Change the message
* Radio broadcasts to all microbits within reach. Create a private message between two specific microbits.

Hint: radio.config(channel=20)

### Example Solution

```python

{% include solutions/microbit/twitter.py %}

```
