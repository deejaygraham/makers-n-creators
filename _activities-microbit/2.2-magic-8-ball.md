## 2.2 Magic 8 Ball

Re-create the prediction toy using the microbit’s gesture recognition function. Ask the microbit a question, shake it and read the answer


### Notes

* gestures - gesture names are shortcuts for groups of movements that the microbit recognises without the need to individually record and identify complex 3-d changes.
* random - random.choice picks one item from a list and returns it at “random”. Random is never really random for most computers.
* scroll - the microbit only has room to display one letter at a time (which is why some letters are upper case and others are lower case) display.scroll displays a long string of text letter by letter.


### Extensions

* Add more answers to the list (be careful about quotes and commas) or change the current list


### Example Solution

```python

from microbit import *
import random

answers = [
    "Without a doubt",
    "Yes, definitely",
    "Most likely",
    "Outlook good",
    "Yes",
    "Signs point to yes",
    "Reply hazy try again",
    "Ask again later",
    "Better not tell you now”,
    "Cannot predict now",
    "Don't count on it”,
    "My reply is no",
    "Very doubtful"
]

while True:
    display.show("8")

    if accelerometer.was_gesture("shake"):
        display.clear()
        sleep(1000)
        display.scroll(random.choice(answers))

```
