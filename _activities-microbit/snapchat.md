The microbit radio can be used to send text over short distances. In this exercise we will try sending images encoded as text
messages to microbits in the local area. The same code can be used on each microbit for sending and receiving.


### Extensions

* Change the image
* Radio broadcasts to all microbits within reach. Create a private message between two specific microbits.


### Example Solution

```python

{% include solutions/microbit/snapchat.py %}

```
