title: Social Rock Paper Scissors
platform: microbit
language: python 
level: 3

The disadvantage of the original rock, paper scissors was that you had to compare the results with a friend.
Extend the original rock paper scissors program to send your selection to another microbit using the
radio, compare the choices automatically and decide who wins.

Remember -
* Rock beats Scissors
* Scissors beat Paper
* Paper beats Rock


### Extensions

* Signal back to each microbit who wins and who loses
* Radio will broadcast to everyone nearby. Come up with a way to pair two devices in a game (hint: maybe like walkie-talkies do?)
