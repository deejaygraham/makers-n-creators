## Step Counter

### Challenge

Fitness tracker to count steps moved during the day.

We need a variable to record the number of steps
We then increase the steps each time we shake the micro:bit
We can display an image to show we took a step


When button A is pressed, 
we show the number of steps
for a short amount of time,
then clear the screen


Desirable:
Show number of steps to target
Set target number of steps
Display motivational messages

Could you record whether a step 
is taken more accurately
