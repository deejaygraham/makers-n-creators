## 2.1 Rock Paper Scissors

In this game, we’ll learn one way to implement the Rock Paper Scissors game for the micro:bit. We’ll
draw images for each of the objects, react to a gesture from the play then use the python random
function to pick one of the objects. In this version the micro:bits are not aware of each other’s
selection so it is up to the players to decide who wins.


### Notes

* gestures - gesture names are shortcuts for groups of movements that the microbit recognises without the need to individually record and identify complex 3-d changes.
* random - random.choice picks one item from a list and returns it at “random”. Random is never really random for most computers.
* image - Images are strings of text, separated by colons to split them into rows, and represent the brightness of each LED in the 5x5 matrix. 0 is off, 9 is fully on.


### Extensions

* Make the images better
* Extend the game to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock


### Example Solution

```python

from microbit import *
import random

rock     = Image("00000:09990:90009:92229:29992")
paper    = Image("99950:90992:90092:90092:99992")
scissors = Image("90009:09090:00900:55055:55055")
rock_paper_scissors = [ rock, paper, scissors ]

display.show(rock_paper_scissors, delay = 500)

display.clear()

while True:

  if accelerometer.was_gesture("shake"):   
	  one_of_them = random.choice(rock_paper_scissors)
		display.show(one_of_them)
		sleep (3000)
    display.clear()

```
