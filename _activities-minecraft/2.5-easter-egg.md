## 2.5 Easter Egg

It's nearly Easter so we can use Minecraft to build something apart from
buildings. How about an Easter Egg?

As before, start up an instance of Pi Minecraft and a terminal window. Write a program to create some blocks to make an egg shape with some stripy bands around it's middle.


### Example Solution

```python

import mcpi.minecraft as minecraft
import mcpi.block as block

world = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

#make the egg - first create some reusable colours
orangeWool = block.Block(35,1)
greyWool = block.Block(35,8)
blueWool = block.Block(35,2)

def make_egg():
	#BAND 1
	world.setBlocks(-5,0,15,5,0,15, block.STONE)
	world.setBlocks(-8,1,15,8,1,15, block.STONE)
	world.setBlocks(-9,3,15,9,2,15, block.STONE)

	#BAND 2
	world.setBlocks(-10,9,15,10,4,15, block.GOLD_ORE)

	#BAND 3
	world.setBlocks(-9,14,15,0,10,15, orangeWool)
	world.setBlocks(0,14,15,9,10,15, blueWool)

	#BAND 4
	world.setBlocks(-7,17,15,7,14,15, block.STONE)
  world.setBlocks(-5,20,15,5,17,15, block.STONE)
	world.setBlocks(-2,21,15,2,20,15, block.STONE)

make_egg()

```
