## Teleport

Write a program to move the player to a different place in the world.


### Extensions

* Instead of always moving to one position, move the player a distance (100 blocks?) away
from their current position.
* Move the player a random distance.
* Create a teleport block and only teleport the player if they are standing on that block.
* Only move the player if they are standing on a particular block type.


### Example Solution

```python

import mcpi.minecraft as minecraft

world = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

x = 10
y = 11
z = 12

world.player.setPos(x, y, z)

```
