## Teleport

Write a program to move the player to a different place in the world.


### Extensions

* Instead of always moving to one position, move the player a distance (100 blocks?) away
from their current position.
* Move the player a random distance.
* Create a teleport block and only teleport the player if they are standing on that block.
* Only move the player if they are standing on a particular block type.


### Example Solution

```python

{% include solutions/minecraft-pi/teleport.py %}

```
