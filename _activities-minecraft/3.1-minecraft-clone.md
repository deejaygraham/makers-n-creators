## 3.1 Minecraft Clone

Michael Fogleman has written a clone of minecraft in python which you can run as a single, stand-alone program on a laptop. In this session, we will
get the program running, make changes to the python code and see what we can change in the world.


### Prerequisites

Download the program main.py and texture.png from https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft. Follow the instructions for building and running.


### Before you begin

Keep a copy of the main.py file in case you ever want to go back to the unmodified version.


### Challenges

* When the program starts up, it automatically generates some hills, trees etc. Change how
and where they are generated.
* The program comes with fewer block types than the original Minecraft. Work out how to create some more block types.
* At startup, create layers of soil and rock under the grass.
* Build a tunnel or a cave under the ground and join it to the surface with another tunnel.
