## Build a Pyramid

### Challenge

Once you've built a house, we can use loops to build a pyramid by laying down a flat
square of blocks 1 block thick and however big you would like. Then we can shrink the
size of the next square and lay it on top of the first. Continue on until the square is
only 1 block wide and deep.


### Extensions

* Change the depth, width and height of the pyramid.
* Change the code to use a different block type.
* Hollow out the pyramid so that the player can walk around inside it.
* Add a door so that the player can go in and out.
