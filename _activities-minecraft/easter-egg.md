## Easter Egg

It's nearly Easter so we can use Minecraft to build something apart from
buildings. How about an Easter Egg?

As before, start up an instance of Pi Minecraft and a terminal window. Write a program to create some blocks to make an egg shape with some stripy bands around it's middle.


### Example Solution

```python

{% include solutions/minecraft-pi/easter-egg.py %}

```
