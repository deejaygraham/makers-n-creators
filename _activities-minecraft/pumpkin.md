## Pumpkin

It's nearly Halloween so we can use Minecraft to build something apart from
buildings. How about a pumpkin?

As before, start up an instance of Pi Minecraft and a terminal window. Write a program to create a block of pumpkin coloured material, then remove blocks to "carve" it into a recognizable shape.


### Example Solution

```python

{% include solutions/minecraft-pi/pumpkin.py %}

```
