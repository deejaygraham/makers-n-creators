## 1.1 Hello Python

### Challenge

To be able to call yourself a programmer, you have to start with the traditional
smallest possible program. Write a program to print hello world onto the screen.


### Extensions

* Change the program to print something more interesting


### Example Solution

```python

print('hello, world')

```

or you can do print it as two separate words:

```python

print("hello " + "world")

```

You can also print it more than once:

```python

print("hello world " * 3)

```

You can use this handy trick to create some nice screen effects.

```python

# hard way to draw a border
print("##############################")

# the easy way to draw a border
print("#" * 30)

```
