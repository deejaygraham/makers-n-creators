### Raspberry Pi distance sensor

Using the GPIO pins in Python to create a distance sensor

### Distance Sensor 

We are using the HC-SR04 which has 4 Pins:

* GND
* ECHO
* TRIG
* VCC

| Distance Sensor Pin | Wire Colour | Destination on Raspberry Pi |
| ------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- | 
| GND                 | Black Wire                 | GND (any) |
| ECHO                | White Wire (with Resistor) | GPIO 24 |
| TRIG                | Grey Wire                  | GPIO 23 |
| VCC                 | Red Wire                   | 5v |
 
We will fire a pulse through the TRIG pin and then wait to read a response from the ECHO pin. 


```python

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

TRIG = 23
ECHO = 24

GPIO.setup(TRIG, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(ECHO, GPIO.IN)

GPIO.output(TRIG, False)
print("Letting sensor settle")
time.sleep(2)

GPIO.output(TRIG, True)

time.sleep(0.00001)
GPIO.output(TRIG, False)

while GPIO.input(ECHO)==0:
	pulse_start = time.time()

while GPIO.input(ECHO)==1:
	pulse_end = time.time()

pulse_dur = pulse_end - pulse_start
distance = pulse_dur * 17150
distance = round(distance, 2)

print(str(distance) + " centimetres")

GPIO.cleanup()

```

### Check the distance sensor is working correctly

Copy the code from above then try running it to make sure we get the distance back.


### LEDs

LEDs require a resistor in series to drive current. (They are soldered on already) We just need to connect the different colour-coded wires. (Black to Ground and Red to our control pin)

The LEDs are wired like this:

| LED Cluster  | Raspberry Pin |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Black Cable  | GND (any)     |
| Red Cable Â   | GPIO 18       |


#### Lights test

Check the LEDs are working correctly. Connect up the LEDs and create a new file for the code for that.

```python

import time
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

RED1 = 21
RED2 = 20
GREEN1 = 16
GREEN2 = 26
GREEN3 = 19

GPIO.setup(RED1, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(RED2, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(GREEN1, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(GREEN2, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(GREEN3, GPIO.OUT)


def light_off(index):
	GPIO.output(index, False)

def light_on(index):
	GPIO.output(index, True)

light_off(RED1)
light_off(RED2)
light_off(GREEN1)
light_off(GREEN2)
light_off(GREEN3)

time.sleep(1)

light_on(GREEN3)

time.sleep(1)

light_off(GREEN3)
light_on(GREEN2)

time.sleep(1)

light_off(GREEN2)
light_on(GREEN1)

time.sleep(1)

light_off(GREEN1)
light_on(RED2)

time.sleep(1)

light_off(RED2)
light_on(RED1)

time.sleep(1)

GPIO.cleanup()

```

### Extensions

* Try to use the code we have to put together something where the light shows us when we get too close. 
* You decide what too close is.
