## 1.2 Lions and Tigers and Bears

### Challenge

We can do more than print text to the screen, we can make very simple art. Write a
program to print a simple picture of an animal using pipe character for legs, underscore
character for body and maybe a 0 for a head.


### Extensions

* Change the animal, see which animals are easy to make in text.
* Print a picture of your house or something to represent where you live.


### Example Solution

```python

print("A picture of a dog:")
print(" 0____  ")
print("  ||||  ")

```

or use three speech marks:

```python

print('''
A picture of a dog:
 0____
  ||||
''')

```

```python

print('''
New York City:

   *
   |
   |
  / \
 /   \
|   # |  _____
|     | | #   |
| #   | |   # |

''')

```
