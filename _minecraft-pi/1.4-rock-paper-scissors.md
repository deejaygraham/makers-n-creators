## 1.4 Rock Paper Scissors

### Challenge

Rock paper scissors is a game you can play with a friend but it's also one that you can teach to a computer. Here we will write a program to randomly select one of the alternatives (using the randint function) and ask the player to select their choice. We will compare them and decide who wins.


### Extensions

* Allow the game to be played more than once (while loop?)
* There is a lot of repeated code - e.g. printing symbols. Can that be made into a function?
* The main script is very long (not usually a good thing). How could it be made easier to read or shorter?


### Example Solution

```python

from random import randint

player = input('Pick from rock (r), paper (p) or scissors (s)?')

if player == 'r':
  print('O')
elif player == 'p':
  print('___')
elif player == 's':
  print('>8')
else:
  print('??')

print('vs')

computer = randint(1,3)

if computer == 1:
  computer = 'r'
  print('O')
elif computer == 2:
  computer = 'p'
  print('___')
else:
  computer = 's'
  print('>8')

if player == computer:
  print('DRAW!')
elif player == 'r' and computer == 's':
  print('Player wins!')
elif player == 'r' and computer == 'p':
  print('Computer wins!')
elif player == 'p' and computer == 'r':
  print('Player wins!')
elif player == 'p' and computer == 's':
  print('Computer wins!')
elif player == 's' and computer == 'p':
  print('Player wins!')
elif player == "s" and computer == 'r':
  print('Computer wins!')
else:
  print('Huh?')

```
