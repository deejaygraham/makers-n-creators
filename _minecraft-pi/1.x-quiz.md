 ### Extensions

 Add a few multiple choice questions to your quiz program. Once you have finished making your quiz, get someone else to play it! How did they do? Did they enjoy it? Was it too easy or too hard?

 Can you use a score variable in your quiz program, to keep track of the player's score? This is how the variable could be used:

At the start of the program, set the score to 0.
Whenever a question is answered correctly, add 1 to the player's score. (score = score + 1)
Print the player's score at the end of the quiz.
