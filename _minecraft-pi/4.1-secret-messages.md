### Example Solution

```python

def rot13(unrotated):
    rotated = ""

    for letter in unrotated:
        # Convert to number with ord.
        value = ord(letter)

        # Shift number back or forward.
        if value >= ord('a') and value <= ord('z'):
            if value > ord('m'):
                value -= 13
            else:
                value += 13
        elif value >= ord('A') and value <= ord('Z'):
            if value > ord('M'):
                value -= 13
            else:
                value += 13

        # Append to result.
        rotated += chr(value)

    return rotated


secret = input('Tell me a secret:')
encrypted = rot13(secret)

print("Your secret is safe with me: " + encrypted)

```


### Extensions

* Why is this cipher not very good for security (hint: what happens if you run it again on the encrypted text?)
* Can you come up with a better cipher?
