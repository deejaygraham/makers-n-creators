## 1.3 Pet Naming Service

### Challenge

Write a program to help a new owner to name their dog. For example, a dog could be
called "Rover" or "Spot". Suggest a different name every time the program runs.


### Extensions

* Suggest suitable names for other types of pet. Ask for the kind of animal and
suggest a suitable name.


### Example Solution

```python

import random

names = ['Rover', 'Spot', 'Inca', 'Craig', 'Peter', 'Linda', 'Shirley', 'Chris']
suggestion = random.choice(names)

print("I recommend you call your dog " + suggestion)

```
