## 1.3 Heads or Tails

### Challenge

Write a program to decide if a coin toss is heads or tails (at random). Then ask
the player which way they want to guess and tell them whether they won or not.


### Extensions

* Allow the player to play for as long as they want - type 'quit' to end?
* How could you change the winning decisions to be less complicated?


### Example Solution

```python

import random

player = input('Heads (h) or Tails (t) ?')

coin_choices = ['heads', 'tails']
computer = random.choice(coin_choices)

if player == 'h' and computer == 'heads':
  print('You Win!')
elif player == 't' and computer == 'tails':
  print('You Win!')
else:
  print('Sorry, it was ' + computer)

```
