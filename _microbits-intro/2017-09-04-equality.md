# Equality

Every if statement evaluates to True or False. True and False are Python keywords, which have special meanings attached to them. You can test for the following conditions in your if statements:

* equality (==)
* inequality (!=)
* greater than (>)
* greater than or equal to (>=)
* less than (<)
* less than or equal to (<=)
* if an item is in a list
