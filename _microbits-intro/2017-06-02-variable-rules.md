# Variable Naming Rules

* Variables can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
* Variable names can start with a letter or an underscore, but can not start with a number.
* Spaces are not allowed in variable names, so_we_use_underscores_instead_of_spaces.
* You cannot use Python keywords as variable names.
* Variable names should be descriptive, without being too long.
* Be careful about using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O in places where they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.
* Be careful of spelling mistakes (Python's NameError)!
