# Dogs

We can store any things in a list and use them later. We can also get to any one item in the list.

~~~

dogs = ['border terrier', 'border collie', 'labrador']

for dog in dogs:
    print('I like ' + dogs + 's.')

favourite = dogs[0]

print('I like ' + favourite + ' best.')

~~~

Notice difference between dog and dogs in for. Spot the mistake!
