# Nicer shopping list

Printing the shopping_list didn't look the best. We can do it another way.

~~~

shopping_list = ['eggs', 'bananas', 'bread', 'PS 4']

print('I need to buy:')

for item in shopping_list:
    print(item)

print(' at the shops')

~~~

Notice colon at end of for line and indent for print item.
