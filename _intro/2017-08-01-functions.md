# functions

Functions are a way to parcel up a piece of code so that we can use it more than once in our program. Python has lots of useful functions already but we can write our own.

def print_greeting_to_screen():
  print('hello world')

print_greeting_to_screen()
print_greeting_to_screen()
print_greeting_to_screen()
print_greeting_to_screen()

Notice def keyword, colon and indentation. Indentation is very important in Python.
