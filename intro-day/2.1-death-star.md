## 2.1 Death Star plans

### Challenge

We need to hide the stolen plans for the Death Star inside an innocent looking Python program so that
Darth Vader can't get them back but Obi Wan Kenobi (or another Rebel) can get them by entering the correct
sequence of letters. If the sequence is correct then show the plans otherwise pretend to be an
innocent robot and display a message that doesn't give the game away.


### Example Solution

```python
import random

secret_code = ['a', 'b', 'c']
# ascii art from http://www.ascii-art.de/ascii/s/starwars.txt
death_star_plans = '''

      .          .

  entered_sequence.append(choice)

  if len(entered_sequence) < len(secret_code):
