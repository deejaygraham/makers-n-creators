## 1.3 Gameshow

We are going to play a TV gameshow. Ask the player for a number, if they pick the right one, they win the prize. If not, tell them they lost.

Use the skills and snippets of code you have seen so far to draw some ascii art and ask for input from the player.

### Example Solution

```python

from random import *

print('''
Gameshow!
=========

There's a prize behind one of the 3 doors!
Guess the correct door to win the prize!
  _____   _____   _____
 |     | |     | |     |
 | [1] | | [2] | | [3] |
 |   o | |   o | |   o |
 |_____| |_____| |_____|

Choose a door (1, 2 or 3):
''')

winningDoor = randint(1,3)

chosenDoor = input()
chosenDoor = int(chosenDoor)

print("The chosen door is", chosenDoor)
print("The winning door is", winningDoor)

if chosenDoor == winningDoor:
    print("Well done!")
else:
    print("Unlucky, better luck next time!")

```

### Extensions

* Change the program to allow the person to have more than one go at winning. (Hint: for attempt in range(3):)
* Change the program to score a point each time they pick correctly and end the game once they have scored 3 points (while score < 3:)
